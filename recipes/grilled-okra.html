        <h2>Descriiption</h2>
        <p>I made this asparagus salad one summer evening when I was planning to grill anyway. I had spinach and Parmesan cheese in the fridge, combined them with the grilled asparagus, and was delighted with the outcome. My husband and I love it!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>12 fresh asparagus spears</li>
            <li>6 cups fresh spinach leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seasoned slivered almonds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for low heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Combine oil and lemon juice in a baking dish. Add asparagus and roll until coated.</li>
            <li>Grill asparagus on the preheated grill, turning at least once and brushing with remaining oil-lemon juice mixture, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from the grill and place back into the baking dish. Cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Combine spinach, Parmesan, and almonds in a large bowl. Add asparagus along with any oil-lemon juice mixture from the dish. Toss to blend and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
